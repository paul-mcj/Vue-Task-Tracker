This is a basic project using Vue.js. It is entirely made by following Brad Traversy's [Vue JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs).

The app is not built for production, and its UI is messy as the only purpose of this application is simply to work with the basic features of the Vue.js framework including basic condtional rendering, directives, props passing, and routing.
